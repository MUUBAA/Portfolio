  journey: [
    "My path into technology began with a curiosity for how things work, which quickly evolved into a passion for coding. This drive led me to the National Institute of Posts and Telecommunications (INPT), a top-tier engineering school in Morocco, where I honed my skills in computer science and software development.",
    "During my studies, I became fascinated by the dual power of the internet to connect and to expose. This sparked my interest in web privacy and data protection. I delved into the world of AI and Machine Learning, recognizing their potential to solve some of the most complex privacy challenges.",
    "Now, as a PhD candidate, my work is centered on the intersection of AI and web privacy. I develop novel techniques for detecting and mitigating online tracking, analyzing privacy policies at scale, and building privacy-preserving data systems. My goal is to contribute to a more transparent and trustworthy digital ecosystem.",
