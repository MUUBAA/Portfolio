  journey: [
    "My path into technology began with a curiosity for how things work, which quickly evolved into a passion for coding. This drive led me to the Karpagam Academy of Higher Education (KAHE), one of the top-tier University in Coimbatore, where I honed my skills in computer science and software development.",
    "During my studies, I became fascinated by the dual power of the internet to connect and to expose. This sparked my interest in web privacy and data protection. I delved into the world of AI and Machine Learning, recognizing their potential to solve some of the most complex privacy challenges.",
    "Now, as Fullstack Developer and Ai Engineer, my work is centered on the intersection of AI and web privacy. I develop novel techniques for detecting and mitigating online tracking, analyzing privacy policies at scale, and building privacy-preserving data systems. My goal is to contribute to a more transparent and trustworthy digital ecosystem.",
