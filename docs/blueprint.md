# **App Name**: Seera Digital Twin

## Core Features:

- Content Replication: Replicate the content from the Seera contact page, including text, images, and layout, to the best extent possible within a Next.js environment.
- Form Implementation: Create a functional contact form mirroring the original, enabling users to submit messages.
- AI-Powered Content Suggestions: An AI tool will suggest alternative or enhanced content for the cloned site, to aid in possible divergence from the original later on. The tool will identify key textual elements of the original website and suggest enhanced, semantically-related versions for consideration by the user.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the cloned page is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Interactive Elements: Recreate any interactive elements (buttons, animations) found on the original page.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#4db6ac) for a modern and calming feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#f0f0f0) to provide a neutral backdrop, not too contrasty since the teal is light
- Accent color: Dark cyan (#00867d) for call to action elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean, contemporary look.
- Maintain a clean and spacious layout to enhance readability and user experience.
- Incorporate subtle animations (e.g., hover effects) to add interactivity without being distracting.
- Utilize a consistent style of minimalist icons.
